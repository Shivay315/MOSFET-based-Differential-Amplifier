# Differential Amplifier (Cadence)

This project involves the design, simulation, and analysis of a **differential amplifier** using **Cadence Virtuoso**. It focuses on frequency response analysis and includes calculation of key performance parameters such as **Bandwidth** and **Unity Gain Bandwidth**.

## Abstract

The differential amplifier is a core analog circuit used in operational amplifiers and signal processing systems. This project involves simulating the differential pair using Cadence tools, analyzing its AC response, and calculating essential frequency-domain parameters.

## Theory ðŸ§ 

### Differential Amplifier Basics
A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals. It is widely used as the input stage of operational amplifiers due to its high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and good linearity.

---

### âž¤ Differential Gain (A<sub>vd</sub>)

The differential-mode gain is defined as:

\[
A_{vd} = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in+} - V_{in-}}
\]

- If the AC magnitude is 1V at `vin+` and `vin-` is grounded, then:

\[
A_{vd} = |V_{out}|
\]

Or in decibels (dB):

\[
A_{vd(dB)} = 20 \cdot \log_{10}(A_{vd})
\]

---

### âž¤ Bandwidth (BW)

Bandwidth is the frequency range over which the gain remains constant (within -3 dB of maximum gain):

\[
BW = f_{H} - f_{L}
\]

Where:
- \( f_H \) = Upper cutoff frequency (gain drops by 3 dB)
- \( f_L \) = Lower cutoff frequency

---

### âž¤ Unity-Gain Bandwidth

The **Unity-Gain Bandwidth** is the frequency at which the gain becomes 1 (0 dB):

\[
\text{UGBW} = \text{frequency at which } |A_{vd}| = 1
\]

---

### âž¤ Common-Mode Gain (A<sub>vc</sub>)

Common-mode gain measures how much of the same signal applied to both inputs appears at the output:

\[
A_{vc} = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in+} = V_{in-}}
\]

Ideally, \( A_{vc} = 0 \)

---

### âž¤ Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)

CMRR indicates how well the amplifier rejects common-mode signals:

\[
\text{CMRR} = \frac{A_{vd}}{A_{vc}}
\quad \text{or in dB:} \quad
\text{CMRR}_{dB} = 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_{vd}}{A_{vc}} \right)
\]

Higher CMRR = better differential performance.

---

### âž¤ Gain from Device Parameters

In long-channel approximation, the differential gain can also be estimated using device parameters:

\[
A_{vd} = g_m \cdot R_D
\quad \text{where} \quad
g_m = \mu_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{th})
\]

Or,

\[
g_m = \frac{2I_D}{V_{ov}} = \frac{2I_D}{V_{GS} - V_{th}}
\]

## Results

| Parameter              | Value         |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Differential Gain (Ad) | Depends on Bias |
| **3dB Bandwidth**          | **177 MHz** |
